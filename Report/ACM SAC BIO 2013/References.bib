    comment = {* BLAT computes an index of all non-overlapping K-mers in the genome and 
* then it uses this index to find matches between the query and the genome
* it can connect matches together, most useful when aligning cDNA to the genome (one gene = N exons connected together)
* one can specify a minimal identity

* BLAT builds up an index of nonoverlapping K-mers and their positions in the database. BLAT excludes K-mers that occur too often from the index, as well as K-mers containing ambiguity codes and optionally K-mers that are in lowercase rather than uppercase.
* BLAT then looks up each overlapping K-mer of the query sequence in the index. In this way, BLAT builds a list ofùhits where the query and the target match. Each hit contains a database position and a query position.
* The following algorithm is used to efficiently clump together multiple hits. The hit list is split into buckets of 64k each, based on the database position. Each bucket is sorted on the diagonal (database minus query positions). Hits that are within the gap limit are bundled together into proto-clumps. Hits within proto-clumps are then sorted along the database coordinate and put into real clumps if they are within the window limit on the database coordinate. To avoid missed clumps near the 64k bucket boundary, un-clumped hits and clumps that are within the window limit are tossed into the next bucket for additional clumping opportunities. The sorting algorithm mSort, which is related to qSort, is used. The bucketing tends to keep N relatively small.
* Clumps with less than the minimum number of hits are discarded, and the rest are used to define regions of the database which are homologous to the query sequence. Clumps which are within 300 bases or 100 amino acids in the database are merged together. Five hundred additional bases are added on each side to form the final homologous region.
* The alignment stage performs a detailed alignment between the query sequence and the homologous regions.
* It is often the case that the alignment of a gene is scattered across multiple homologous regions found in the search phase. These alignments are stitched together using a minor variation of the algorithm used to stitch together protein HSPs. For DNA alignments at this stage, the gap penalty is equal to a constant plus the log of the size of the gap. For mRNA/genomic alignments, if after stitching there are gaps left between aligning blocks in both the database and query sequence, the nucleotide alignment algorithm is called on the gap to attempt to fill it in.

multiscale representations, and mixed discrete and continuous variables. Although exact inference in these generalizations is usually intractable, one can use approximate inference
algorithms such as Markov chain sampling and variational methods. We describe
how such methods are applied to these generalized hidden Markov models. We conclude this review with a discussion of Bayesian methods for model selection in generalized HMMs.}},

    abstract = {{This paper presents a new technique for modeling heterogeneous
data sources such as speech signals received via distinctly different
channels. Such a scenario arises when an automatic speech recognition
system is deployed in wireless telephony in which highly heterogeneous
channels coexist and interoperate. The problem is that a simple model
may become inadequate to describe accurately the diversity of the
signal, resulting in an unsatisfactory recognition performance. To deal
with such a problem, we propose a generalized mixture model (GMM)
approach. For speech signals, in particular, we use mixtures of hidden
Markov models (i.e., GMHMM, generalized mixture of HMMs). By applying
discriminative training for GMHMM we obtained 1.0\% word error rate for
the recognition of the digits strings from the wireless database,
comparing to 1.4\% word error rate for the conventional HMM based
discriminative technique}},

Petrie (1966) and gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory along with a description of selected applications of the theory to distinct problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described}},

Adaption for different problems is done by designing the models and, if necessary, extending the formalism. The General Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) C-library provides production-quality implementations of basic and advanced aspects of HMMs. The architecture is build around the software library, adding wrappers for using the library interactively from the languages Python and R and applications with graphical user interfaces for specific analysis and modeling tasks. We have found, that the GHMM can drastically reduce the effort for tackling novel research questions. We focus on the Graphical Query Language (GQL) application for analyzing experiments which measure the expression (or mRNA) levels of many genes simultaneously over time. Our approach, combining HMMs in a statistical mixture model, using partially supervised learning as the paradigm for training results in a highly effective, robust analysis tool for finding groups of genes sharing the same pattern of expression over time, even in the presence of high levels of noise.}},

@article{hsu2002,
    abstract = {{Support vector machines (SVMs) were originally designed for binary
classification. How to effectively extend it for multiclass
classification is still an ongoing research issue. Several methods have
been proposed where typically we construct a multiclass classifier by
combining several binary classifiers. Some authors also proposed methods
that consider all classes at once. As it is computationally more
expensive to solve multiclass problems, comparisons of these methods
using large-scale problems have not been seriously conducted. Especially
for methods solving multiclass SVM in one step, a much larger
optimization problem is required so up to now experiments are limited to
small data sets. In this paper we give decomposition implementations for
two such "all-together" methods. We then compare their performance with
three methods based on binary classifications: "one-against-all,"
"one-against-one," and directed acyclic graph SVM (DAGSVM). Our
experiments indicate that the "one-against-one" and DAG methods are more
suitable for practical use than the other methods. Results also show
that for large problems methods by considering all data at once in
general need fewer support vectors}},

    abstract = {{The massive volume of SNP data available requires the use of adequate computational strategies to properly handle it. Identify the SNP-SNP and SNP-environment combinations that better explain the propensity for a certain disease. We introduce a website (https://jaqueira.cin.ufpe.br/pit/faces/index.jsp) where three previously reported and a new method for SNP-SNP interaction are implemented, and can be executed individually or all together for the same dataset. We also present the results of a case-control study of those methods, based on 70 epistatic models, varying rates for heritability and for minor allele frequency. The experiments also consider different numbers of SNPs and sizes of case-control sets. We observe that for a small number of SNPs, the four methods are statistically equal, but when the number of SNPs grow, they have different behavior, except for ESNP2 and our method. Although the methods are exhaustive, in general, in our analysis ESNP2 runs much faster and achieves better accuracy. Nonetheless, the performance of ESNP2 can be disturbed in a scenario where a single gene can explain most of the epistatic effects. In those cases, considering the interaction effects of all SNPs, instead of only the most significant, can deliver more accurate results. A proposed method, called Multi-Approach SNP-SNP Interaction Analysis (MASS), although statistically equal to ESNP2, achieves better results than ESNP2 in that situation. Our experiments show that specific epistatic models lead to particularly better or worse performance. While a small value for minor allele frequency can negatively impact the accuracy, small heritability rates if the single variation studied that has the strongest negative impact on the accuracy.}},

    abstract = {{Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a well-established procedure used to investigate interactions between proteins and DNA. Coupled with whole-genome DNA microarrays, ChIPs allow one to determine the entire spectrum of in vivo DNA binding sites for any given protein. The design and analysis of ChIP-microarray (also called ChIP-chip) experiments differ significantly from the conventions used for more traditional microarray experiments that measure relative transcript levels. Furthermore, fundamental differences exist between single-locus ChIP approaches and ChIP-chip experiments, and these differences require new methods of analysis. In this light, we review the design of DNA microarrays, the selection of controls, the level of repetition required, and other critical parameters for success in the design and analysis of ChIP-chip experiments, especially those conducted in the context of mammalian or other relatively large genomes.}},

Comparative genomics has recently been used to identify potential cis-regulatory sequences within the yeast genome on the basis of phylogenetic conservation, but this information alone does not reveal if or when transcriptional regulators occupy these binding sites. We have constructed an initial map of yeast's transcriptional regulatory code by identifying the sequence elements that are bound by regulators under various conditions and that are conserved among Saccharomyces species. The organization of regulatory elements in promoters and the environment-dependent use of these elements by regulators are discussed. We find that environment-specific use of regulatory elements predicts mechanistic models for the function of a large population of yeast's transcriptional regulators.}},

                Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a technique for genome-wide profiling of DNA-binding proteins, histone modifications or nucleosomes. Owing to the tremendous progress in next-generation sequencing technology, ChIP-seq offers higher resolution, less noise and greater coverage than its array-based predecessor ChIP-chip. With the decreasing cost of sequencing, ChIP-seq has become an indispensable tool for studying gene regulation and epigenetic mechanisms. In this Review, I describe the benefits and challenges in harnessing this technique with an emphasis on issues related to experimental design and data analysis. ChIP-seq experiments generate large quantities of data, and effective computational analysis will be crucial for uncovering biological mechanisms.

                Molecular interactions between protein complexes and DNA mediate essential gene-regulatory functions. Uncovering such interactions by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has recently become the focus of intense interest. We here introduce quantitative enrichment of sequence tags (QuEST), a powerful statistical framework based on the kernel density estimation approach, which uses ChIP-Seq data to determine positions where protein complexes contact DNA. Using QuEST, we discovered several thousand binding sites for the human transcription factors SRF, GABP and NRSF at an average resolution of about 20 base pairs. MEME motif-discovery tool-based analyses of the QuEST-identified sequences revealed DNA binding by cofactors of SRF, providing evidence that cofactor binding specificity can be obtained from ChIP-Seq data. By combining QuEST analyses with Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and expression data, we illustrate how general functions of transcription factors can be inferred.

We have generated high-resolution maps for the genome-wide distribution of 20 histone lysine and arginine methylations as well as histone variant H2A.Z, RNA polymerase II, and the insulator binding protein CTCF across the human genome using the Solexa 1G sequencing technology. Typical patterns of histone methylations exhibited at promoters, insulators, enhancers, and transcribed regions are identified. The monomethylations of H3K27, H3K9, H4K20, H3K79, and H2BK5 are all linked to gene activation, whereas trimethylations of H3K27, H3K9, and H3K79 are linked to repression. H2A.Z associates with functional regulatory elements, and CTCF marks boundaries of histone methylation domains. Chromosome banding patterns are correlated with unique patterns of histone modifications. Chromosome breakpoints detected in T cell cancers frequently reside in chromatin regions associated with H3K4 methylations. Our data provide new insights into the function of histone methylation and chromatin organization in genome function.}},

                Abstract We analyzed 198 datasets of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and developed a methodology for identification of high-confidence enhancer and promoter regions from transcription factor ChIP-seq data alone. We identify 32,467 genomic regions marked with ChIP-seq binding peaks in 15 or more experiments as high-confidence cis-regulatory regions. Although the selected regions mark only ‚àº0.67\% of the genome, 70.5\% of our predicted binding regions fall within independently identified, strongly expression-correlated and histone-marked enhancer regions, which cover ‚àº8\% of the genome (Ernst et al., Nature 2011 , 473, 43-49). Even more remarkably, 85.6\% of our selected regions overlap transcription factor (TF) binding regions identified in evolutionarily conserved DNase1 hypersensitivity cluster regions, which cover 0.75\% of the genome (Boyle et al., Genome Research 2011 , 21, 456-464). P-values for these overlaps are effectively zero (Z-scores of 328 and 715 respectively). Furthermore, 62\% of our selected regions overlap the intersection of the evolutionarily conserved DNase1 hypersensitivity-identified TF-binding regions of Boyle et al. ( 2011 ) with the histone-marked enhancers found to be strongly associated with transcriptional activity by Ernst et al. ( 2011 ). Two hundred thirty of our candidate cis-regulatory regions overlap cancer-associated variants reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/ ). We also identify 1,252 potential proximal promoters for the 7,561 disjoint lincRNA regions currently in the Human lincRNA Catalog ( www.broadinstitute.org/genome\_bio/human\_lincrnas/ ). Our investigation used approximately half of all currently available ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets, suggesting further gains are likely from analysis of all datasets currently available.

    abstract = {{Motivation Accurate knowledge of the genome-wide binding of transcription factors in a particular cell type or under a particular condition is necessary for understanding transcriptional regulation. Using epigenetic data such as histone modification and DNase I, accessibility data has been shown to improve motif-based in silico methods for predicting such binding, but this approach has not yet been fully explored.Results We describe a probabilistic method for combining one or more tracks of epigenetic data with a standard DNA sequence motif model to improve our ability to identify active transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). We convert each data type into a position-specific probabilistic prior and combine these priors with a traditional probabilistic motif model to compute a log-posterior odds score. Our experiments, using histone modifications H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K27ac, as well as DNase I sensitivity, show conclusively that the log-posterior odds score consistently outperforms a simple binary filter based on the same data. We also show that our approach performs competitively with a more complex method, CENTIPEDE, and suggest that the relative simplicity of the log-posterior odds scoring method makes it an appealing and very general method for identifying functional TFBSs on the basis of DNA and epigenetic evidence.Availability and implementation: FIMO, part of the MEME Suite software toolkit, now supports log-posterior odds scoring using position-specific priors for motif search.

Although individual modifications have been linked to the activity levels of various genetic functional elements, their combinatorial patterns are still unresolved and their potential for systematic de novo genome annotation remains untapped. Here, we use a multivariate Hidden Markov Model to reveal 'chromatin states' in human T cells, based on recurrent and spatially coherent combinations of chromatin marks. We define 51 distinct chromatin states, including promoter-associated, transcription-associated, active intergenic, large-scale repressed and repeat-associated states. Each chromatin state shows specific enrichments in functional annotations, sequence motifs and specific experimentally observed characteristics, suggesting distinct biological roles. This approach provides a complementary functional annotation of the human genome that reveals the genome-wide locations of diverse classes of epigenetic function.}},

                Eukaryotic gene transcription is accompanied by acetylation and methylation of nucleosomes near promoters, but the locations and roles of histone modifications elsewhere in the genome remain unclear. We determined the chromatin modification states in high resolution along 30 Mb of the human genome and found that active promoters are marked by trimethylation of Lys4 of histone H3 (H3K4), whereas enhancers are marked by monomethylation, but not trimethylation, of H3K4. We developed computational algorithms using these distinct chromatin signatures to identify new regulatory elements, predicting over 200 promoters and 400 enhancers within the 30-Mb region. This approach accurately predicted the location and function of independently identified regulatory elements with high sensitivity and specificity and uncovered a novel functional enhancer for the carnitine transporter SLC22A5 (OCTN2). Our results give insight into the connections between chromatin modifications and transcriptional regulatory activity and provide a new tool for the functional annotation of the human genome.

    abstract = {{Transcriptional regulation in human cells is a complex process involving a multitude of regulatory elements encoded by the genome. Recent studies have shown that distinct chromatin signatures mark a variety of functional genomic elements and that subtle variations of these signatures mark elements with different functions. To identify novel chromatin signatures in the human genome, we apply a de novo pattern-finding algorithm to genome-wide maps of histone modifications. We recover previously known chromatin signatures associated with promoters and enhancers. We also observe several chromatin signatures with strong enrichment of H3K36me3 marking exons. Closer examination reveals that H3K36me3 is found on well-positioned nucleosomes at exon 5' ends, and that this modification is a global mark of exon expression that also correlates with alternative splicing. Additionally, we observe strong enrichment of H2BK5me1 and H4K20me1 at highly expressed exons near the 5' end, in contrast to the opposite distribution of H3K36me3-marked exons. Finally, we also recover frequently occurring chromatin signatures displaying enrichment of repressive histone modifications. These signatures mark distinct repeat sequences and are associated with distinct modes of gene repression. Together, these results highlight the rich information embedded in the human epigenome and underscore its value in studying gene regulation. Recent studies have observed that histone tails can be modified in a variety of ways. Analyzing a collection of 21 histone modifications, we attempted to determine what common signatures are associated with different classes of regulatory elements and whether they mark places of distinct function. Indeed, at promoters, we identified a number of distinct signatures, each associated with a different class of expressed and functional genes. We also observed several unexpected signatures marking exons that directly correlate with the expression of exons. Finally, we recovered many places marked by two distinct repressive modifications, and showed that they mark distinct populations of repetitive elements associated with distinct modes of gene repression. Together, these results highlight the rich information embedded in the human epigenome and underscore its value in studying gene regulation.}},

Genomic DNA sequence information provides a basis for these predictions, due to the sequence specificity of TF-binding events. However, DNA sequence alone is an impoverished source of information for the task of TFBS prediction in eukaryotes, as additional factors, such as chromatin structure regulate binding events. We show that incorporating high-throughput chromatin modification estimates can greatly improve the accuracy of in silico prediction of in vivo binding for a wide range of TFs in human and mouse. This improvement is superior to the improvement gained by equivalent use of either transcription start site proximity or phylogenetic conservation information. Importantly, predictions made with the use of chromatin structure information are tissue specific. This result supports the biological hypothesis that chromatin modulates TF binding to produce tissue-specific binding profiles in higher eukaryotes, and suggests that the use of chromatin modification information can lead to accurate tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory network elucidation.}},

                WebLogo generates sequence logos, graphical representations of the patterns within a multiple sequence alignment. Sequence logos provide a richer and more precise description of sequence similarity than consensus sequences and can rapidly reveal significant features of the alignment otherwise difficult to perceive. Each logo consists of stacks of letters, one stack for each position in the sequence. The overall height of each stack indicates the sequence conservation at that position (measured in bits), whereas the height of symbols within the stack reflects the relative frequency of the corresponding amino or nucleic acid at that position. WebLogo has been enhanced recently with additional features and options, to provide a convenient and highly configurable sequence logo generator. A command line interface and the complete, open WebLogo source code are available for local installation and customization.

    abstract = {{The interaction of proteins with DNA recognition motifs regulates a number of fundamental biological processes, including transcription. To understand these processes, we need to know which motifs are present in a sequence and which factors bind to them. We describe a method to screen a set of DNA sequences against a precompiled library of motifs, and assess which, if any, of the motifs are statistically over-ê or under-êrepresented in the sequences. Over-êrepresented motifs are good candidates for playing a functional role in the sequences, while under-êrepresentation hints that if the motif were present, it would have a harmful dysregulatory effect. We apply our method (implemented as a computer program called Clover) to dopamine-responsive promoters, sequences flanking binding sites for the transcription factor LSF, sequences that direct transcription in muscle and liver, and Drosophila segmentation enhancers. In each case Clover successfully detects motifs known to function in the sequences, and intriguing and testable hypotheses are made concerning additional motifs. Clover compares favorably with an ab initio motif discovery algorithm based on sequence alignment, when the motif library includes only a homolog of the factor that actually regulates the sequences. It also demonstrates superior performance over two contingency table based over-representation methods. In conclusion, Clover has the potential to greatly accelerate characterization of signals that regulate transcription.}},

The characters representing the sequence are stacked on top of each other for each position in the aligned sequences. The height of each letter is made proportional to its frequency, and the letters are sorted so the most common one is on top. The height of the entire stack is then adjusted to signify the information content of the sequences at that position. From these 'sequence logos', one can determine not only the consensus sequence but also the relative frequency of bases and the information content (measured in bits) at every position in a site or sequence. The logo displays both significant residues and subtle sequence patterns.

                Repressors, polymerases, ribosomes and other macromolecules bind to specific nucleic acid sequences. They can find a binding site only if the sequence has a recognizable pattern. We define a measure of the information (R sequence) in the sequence patterns at binding sites. It allows one to investigate how information is distributed across the sites and to compare one site to another. One can also calculate the amount of information (R frequency) that would be required to locate the sites, given that they occur with some frequency in the genome. Several Escherichia coli binding sites were analyzed using these two independent empirical measurements. The two amounts of information are similar for most of the sites we analyzed. In contrast, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase binding sites contain about twice as much information as is necessary for recognition by the T7 polymerase, suggesting that a second protein may bind at T7 promoters. The extra information can be accounted for by a strong symmetry element found at the T7 promoters. This element may be an operator. If this model is correct, these promoters and operators do not share much information. The comparisons between R sequence and R frequency suggest that the information at binding sites is just sufficient for the sites to be distinguished from the rest of the genome.

    abstract = {{Analysis of the human genome sequence has identified approximately 25000-30000 protein-coding genes, but little is known about how most of these are regulated. Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites has traditionally represented the gold-standard experimental method for identifying regulatory elements, but the labor-intensive nature of this technique has limited its application to only a small number of human genes. We have developed a protocol to generate a genome-wide library of gene regulatory sequences by cloning DNase HS sites. We generated a library of DNase HS sites from quiescent primary human CD4(+) T cells and analyzed approximately 5600 of the resulting clones. Compared to sequences from randomly generated in silico libraries, sequences from these clones were found to map more frequently to regions of the genome known to contain regulatory elements, such as regions upstream of genes, within CpG islands, and in sequences that align between mouse and human. These cloned sites also tend to map near genes that have detectable transcripts in CD4(+) T cells, demonstrating that transcriptionally active regions of the genome are being selected. Validation of putative regulatory elements was achieved by repeated recovery of the same sequence and real-time PCR. This cloning strategy, which can be scaled up and applied to any cell line or tissue, will be useful in identifying regulatory elements controlling global expression differences that delineate tissue types, stages of development, and disease susceptibility.}},

We used DNase-chip to identify DNase I hypersensitive sites accurately from a representative 1\% of the human genome in both primary and immortalized cell types.

Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites within nuclear chromatin is a powerful and well-established method of identifying many different types of regulatory elements, but in the past it has been limited to analysis of single loci. We have recently described a protocol to generate a genome-wide library of DNase HS sites. Here, we report high-throughput analysis, using massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), of 230,000 tags from a DNase library generated from quiescent human CD4+ T cells. Of the tags that uniquely map to the genome, we identified 14,190 clusters of sequences that group within close proximity to each other. By using a real-time PCR strategy, we determined that the majority of these clusters represent valid DNase HS sites. Approximately 80\% of these DNase HS sites uniquely map within one or more annotated regions of the genome believed to contain regulatory elements, including regions 2 kb upstream of genes, CpG islands, and highly conserved sequences. Most DNase HS sites identified in CD4+ T cells are also HS in CD8+ T cells, B cells, hepatocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and HeLa cells. However, ‚àº10\% of the DNase HS sites are lymphocyte specific, indicating that this procedure can identify gene regulatory elements that control cell type specificity. This strategy, which can be applied to any cell line or tissue, will enable a better understanding of how chromatin structure dictates cell function and fate.}},

Focal alteration in chromatin structure in vivo, detectable through hypersensitivity to DNaseI and other nucleases, is the sine qua non of a diverse cast of transcriptional regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, and locus control regions. We developed an approach for genome-scale identification of DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) via isolation and cloning of in vivo DNaseI cleavage sites to create libraries of active chromatin sequences (ACSs). Here, we describe analysis of >61,000 ACSs derived from erythroid cells. We observed peaks in the density of ACSs at the transcriptional start sites of known genes at non-gene-associated CpG islands, and, to a lesser degree, at evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences. Peaks in ACS density paralleled the distribution of DNaseI HSs. ACSs and DNaseI HSs were distributed between both expressed and nonexpressed genes, suggesting that a large proportion of genes reside within open chromatin domains. The results permit a quantitative approximation of the distribution of HSs and classical cis-regulatory sequences in the human genome.}},

Tags were mapped to the human genome, and a quantitative algorithm was applied to discriminate statistically significant clusters of independent DNase I cutting events. We show that such clusters identify both known regulatory sequences and previously unrecognized functional elements across the genome. We used in silico simulation to demonstrate that DACS is capable of efficient and accurate localization of the majority of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the human genome without requiring an independent validation step. A unique feature of DACS is that it permits unbiased evaluation of the chromatin state of regulatory sequences from widely separated genomic loci. We found surprisingly large differences in the accessibility of distant regulatory sequences, suggesting the existence of a hierarchy of nuclear organization that escapes detection by conventional chromatin assays.}},

Here we describe a high-resolution, genome-scale approach for quantifying chromatin accessibility by measuring DNase I sensitivity as a continuous function of genome position using tiling DNA microarrays (DNase-array). We demonstrate this approach across 1\% ( approximately 30 Mb) of the human genome, wherein we localized 2,690 classical DNase I hypersensitive sites with high sensitivity and specificity, and also mapped larger-scale patterns of chromatin architecture. DNase I hypersensitive sites exhibit marked aggregation around transcriptional start sites (TSSs), though the majority mark nonpromoter functional elements. We also developed a computational approach for visualizing higher-order features of chromatin structure. This revealed that human chromatin organization is dominated by large (100-500 kb) 'superclusters' of DNase I hypersensitive sites, which encompass both gene-rich and gene-poor regions. DNase-array is a powerful and straightforward approach for systematic exposition of the cis-regulatory architecture of complex genomes.}},

The advent of next-generation sequencing has provided a powerful platform for genome-wide analysis of different species and specific cell types; when combined with traditional techniques to identify regions of open chromatin [DNaseI hypersensitivity (DHS)] or specific binding locations of transcription factors [chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)], and expression data from microarrays, we become uniquely poised to uncover the mysteries of the genome and its regulation. To this end, we have performed global meta-analysis of the relationship among data from DNaseI-seq, ChIP-seq and expression arrays, and found that specific correlations exist among regulatory elements and gene expression across different cell types. These correlations revealed four distinct modes of chromatin domain structure reflecting different functions: repressive, active, primed and bivalent. Furthermore, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites were identified based on these integrative data. Our findings uncovered a complex regulatory process involving by DNaseI HS sites and histone modifications, and suggest that these dynamic elements may be responsible for maintaining chromatin structure and integrity of the human genome. Our integrative approach provides an example by which data from diverse technology platforms may be integrated to provide more meaningful insights into global transcriptional regulation.}},

Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites has historically been a valuable tool for identifying all different types of regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. This method utilizes DNase I to selectively digest nucleosome-depleted DNA (presumably by transcription factors), whereas DNA regions tightly wrapped in nucleosome and higher-order structures are more resistant. The traditional low-throughput method for identifying DNase I HS sites uses Southern blots. Here, we describe the complete and improved protocol for DNase-seq, a high-throughput method that identifies DNase I HS sites across the whole genome by capturing DNase-digested fragments and sequencing them by high-throughput, next-generation sequencing. In a single experiment, DNase-seq can identify most active regulatory regions from potentially any cell type, from any species with a sequenced genome. 10.1101/pdb.prot5384}},

%%%%% Negative Sampling Problem

@article{bandyopadhyay2009,
    abstract = {{Motivation: Prediction of microRNA (miRNA) target mRNAs using machine learning approaches is an important area of research. However, most of the methods suffer from either high false positive or false negative rates. One reason for this is the marked deficiency of negative examples or miRNA non-target pairs. Systematic identification of non-target mRNAs is still not addressed properly, and therefore, current machine learning approaches are compelled to rely on artificially generated negative examples for training.  Results: In this article, we have identified [\~{}]300 tissue-specific negative examples using a novel approach that involves expression profiling of both miRNAs and mRNAs, miRNA-mRNA structural interactions and seed-site conservation. The newly generated negative examples are validated with pSILAC dataset, which elucidate the fact that the identified non-targets are indeed non-targets.These high-throughput tissue-specific negative examples and a set of experimentally verified positive examples are then used to build a system called TargetMiner, a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier. In addition to assessing the prediction accuracy on cross-validation experiments, TargetMiner has been validated with a completely independent experimental test dataset. Our method outperforms 10 existing target prediction algorithms and provides a good balance between sensitivity and specificity that is not reflected in the existing methods. We achieve a significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of 69\% and 67.8\% based on a pool of 90 feature set and 76.5\% and 66.1\% using a set of 30 selected feature set on the completely independent test dataset.  In order to establish the effectiveness of the systematically generated negative examples, the SVM is trained using a different set of negative data generated using the method in Yousef et al. A significantly higher false positive rate (70.6\%) is observed when tested on the independent set, while all other factors are kept the same.

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Recently, supervised learning methods have been exploited to reconstruct gene regulatory networks from gene expression data. The reconstruction of a network is modeled as a binary classification problem for each pair of genes. A statistical classifier is trained to recognize the relationships between the activation profiles of gene pairs. This approach has been proven to outperform previous unsupervised methods. However, the supervised approach raises open questions. In particular, although known regulatory connections can safely be assumed to be positive training examples, obtaining negative examples is not straightforward, because definite knowledge is typically not available that a given pair of genes do not interact.RESULTS:A recent advance in research on data mining is a method capable of learning a classifier from only positive and unlabeled examples, that does not need labeled negative examples. Applied to the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks, we show that this method significantly outperforms the current state of the art of machine learning methods. We assess the new method using both simulated and experimental data, and obtain major performance improvement.CONCLUSIONS:Compared to unsupervised methods for gene network inference, supervised methods are potentially more accurate, but for training they need a complete set of known regulatory connections. A supervised method that can be trained using only positive and unlabeled data, as presented in this paper, is especially beneficial for the task of inferring gene regulatory networks, because only an incomplete set of known regulatory connections is available in public databases such as RegulonDB, TRRD, KEGG, Transfac, and IPA.}},

    abstract = {{Motivation: A number of computational methods have been proposed that predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) based on protein sequence features. Since the number of potential non-interacting protein pairs (negative PPIs) is very high both in absolute terms and in comparison to that of interacting protein pairs (positive PPIs), computational prediction methods rely upon subsets of negative PPIs for training and validation. Hence, the need arises for subset sampling for negative PPIs.Results: We clarify that there are two fundamentally different types of subset sampling for negative PPIs. One is subset sampling for cross-validated testing, where one desires unbiased subsets so that predictive performance estimated with them can be safely assumed to generalize to the population level. The other is subset sampling for training, where one desires the subsets that best train predictive algorithms, even if these subsets are biased. We show that confusion between these two fundamentally different types of subset sampling led one study recently published in Bioinformatics to the erroneous conclusion that predictive algorithms based on protein sequence features are hardly better than random in predicting PPIs. Rather, both protein sequence features and the 'hubbiness' of interacting proteins contribute to effective prediction of PPIs. We provide guidance for appropriate use of random versus balanced sampling.Availability: The datasets used for this study are available at http://www.marcottelab.org/PPINegativeDataSampling.Contact: yungki@mail.utexas.edu; marcotte@icmb.utexas.eduSupplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

    abstract = {{Motivation: Defining regulatory networks, linking transcription factors (TFs) to their targets, is a central problem in post-genomic biology. One might imagine one could readily determine these networks through inspection of gene expression data. However, the relationship between the expression timecourse of a transcription factor and its target is not obvious (e.g. simple correlation over the timecourse), and current analysis methods, such as hierarchical clustering, have not been very successful in deciphering them.Results: Here we introduce an approach based on support vector machines (SVMs) to predict the targets of a transcription factor by identifying subtle relationships between their expression profiles. In particular, we used SVMs to predict the regulatory targets for 36 transcription factors in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome based on the microarray expression data from many different physiological conditions. We trained and tested our SVM on a data set constructed to include a significant number of both positive and negative examples, directly addressing data imbalance issues. This was non-trivial given that most of the known experimental information is only for positives. Overall, we found that 63\% of our TF-target relationships were confirmed through cross-validation. We further assessed the performance of our regulatory network identifications by comparing them with the results from two recent genome-wide ChIP-chip experiments. Overall, we find the agreement between our results and these experiments is comparable to the agreement (albeit low) between the two experiments. We find that this network has a delocalized structure with respect to chromosomal positioning, with a given transcription factor having targets spread fairly uniformly across the genome.Availability: The overall network of the relationships is available on the web at http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/expression/echipchip}},

    abstract = {{MOTIVATION: Small non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes play important regulatory roles in a variety of cellular processes. However, detection of ncRNA genes is a great challenge to both experimental and computational approaches. In this study, we describe a new approach called positive sample only learning (PSoL) to predict ncRNA genes in the Escherichia coli genome. Although PSoL is a machine learning method for classification, it requires no negative training data, which, in general, is hard to define properly and affects the performance of machine learning dramatically. In addition, using the support vector machine (SVM) as the core learning algorithm, PSoL can integrate many different kinds of information to improve the accuracy of prediction. Besides the application of PSoL for predicting ncRNAs, PSoL is applicable to many other bioinformatics problems as well. RESULTS: The PSoL method is assessed by 5-fold cross-validation experiments which show that PSoL can achieve about 80\% accuracy in recovery of known ncRNAs. We compared PSoL predictions with five previously published results. The PSoL method has the highest percentage of predictions overlapping with those from other methods.}},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The application of machine learning to classification problems that depend only on positive examples is gaining attention in the computational biology community. We and others have described the use of two-class machine learning to identify novel miRNAs. These methods require the generation of an artificial negative class. However, designation of the negative class can be problematic and if it is not properly done can affect the performance of the classifier dramatically and/or yield a biased estimate of performance. We present a study using one-class machine learning for microRNA (miRNA) discovery and compare one-class to two-class approaches using na\"{i}ve Bayes and Support Vector Machines. These results are compared to published two-class miRNA prediction approaches. We also examine the ability of the one-class and two-class techniques to identify miRNAs in newly sequenced species. RESULTS: Of all methods tested, we found that 2-class naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines gave the best accuracy using our selected features and optimally chosen negative examples. One class methods showed average accuracies of 70-80\% versus 90\% for the two 2-class methods on the same feature sets. However, some one-class methods outperform some recently published two-class approaches with different selected features. Using the EBV genome as and external validation of the method we found one-class machine learning to work as well as or better than a two-class approach in identifying true miRNAs as well as predicting new miRNAs. CONCLUSION: One and two class methods can both give useful classification accuracies when the negative class is well characterized. The advantage of one class methods is that it eliminates guessing at the optimal features for the negative class when they are not well defined. In these cases one-class methods can be superior to two-class methods when the features which are chosen as representative of that positive class are well defined.}},

    abstract = {{Promoters are DNA sequences located upstream of the gene region and play a central role in gene expression. Computational techniques show good accuracy in gene prediction but are less successful in predicting promoters, primarily because of the high number of false positives that reflect characteristics of the promoter sequences. Many machine learning methods have been used to address this issue. Neural Networks (NN) have been successfully used in this field because of their ability to recognize imprecise and incomplete patterns characteristic of promoter sequences. In this paper, NN was used to predict and recognize promoter sequences in two data sets: (i) one based on nucleotide sequence information and (ii) another based on stability sequence information. The accuracy was approximately 80\% for simulation (i) and 68\% for simulation (ii). In the rules extracted, biological consensus motifs were important parts of the NN learning process in both simulations.}},

Here, we iteratively integrate high-throughput, genome-wide measurements of RNA polymerase binding locations and mRNA transcript abundance, 5' sequences and translation into proteins to determine the organizational structure of the Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 genome. Integration of the organizational elements provides an experimentally annotated transcription unit architecture, including alternative transcription start sites, 5' untranslated region, boundaries and open reading frames of each transcription unit. A total of 4,661 transcription units were identified, representing an increase of >530\% over current knowledge. This comprehensive transcription unit architecture allows for the elucidation of condition-specific uses of alternative sigma factors at the genome scale. Furthermore, the transcription unit architecture provides a foundation on which to construct genome-scale transcriptional and translational regulatory networks.}},

    abstract = {{Sequence analysis of 236 promoters recognized by the Bacillus subtilis sigma A-RNA polymerase reveals an extended promoter structure. The most highly conserved bases include the -35 and -10 hexanucleotide core elements and a TG dinucleotide at position -15, -14. In addition, several weakly conserved A and T residues are present upstream of the -35 region. Analysis of dinucleotide composition reveals A2- and T2-rich sequences in the upstream promoter region (-36 to -70) which are phased with the DNA helix: An tracts are common near -43, -54 and -65; Tn tracts predominate at the intervening positions. When compared with larger regions of the genome, upstream promoter regions have an excess of An and Tn sequences for n > 4. These data indicate that an RNA polymerase binding site affects DNA sequence as far upstream as -70. This sequence conservation is discussed in light of recent evidence that the alpha subunits of the polymerase core bind DNA and that the promoter may wrap around RNA polymerase.}},

This paper summarizes the improvements, new biology and new features available in version 6.0. Curation of original literature is, from now on, up to date for every new release. All the objects are supported by their corresponding evidences, now classified as strong or weak. Transcription factors are classified by origin of their effectors and by gene ontology class. We have now computational predictions for sigma(54) and five different promoter types of the sigma(70) family, as well as their corresponding -10 and -35 boxes. In addition to those curated from the literature, we added about 300 experimentally mapped promoters coming from our own high-throughput mapping efforts. RegulonDB v.6.0 now expands beyond transcription initiation, including RNA regulatory elements, specifically riboswitches, attenuators and small RNAs, with their known associated targets. The data can be accessed through overviews of correlations about gene regulation. RegulonDB associated original literature, together with more than 4000 curation notes, can now be searched with the Textpresso text mining engine.

The number of B. subtilis promoters annotated in the database was more than doubled to 1475. In addition, 463 experimentally validated B. subtilis operons and their terminators have been included. Given the increase in the number of fully sequenced bacterial genomes, we decided to extend the usability of DBTBS in comparative regulatory genomics.

Despite the central importance of these proteins in physiology, development, and evolution, comprehensive DNA binding specificities have been determined experimentally for only a few proteins. Here, we used microarrays containing all 10-base pair sequences to examine the binding specificities of 104 distinct mouse DNA binding proteins representing 22 structural classes. Our results reveal a complex landscape of binding, with virtually every protein analyzed possessing unique preferences. Roughly half of the proteins each recognized multiple distinctly different sequence motifs, challenging our molecular understanding of how proteins interact with their DNA binding sites. This complexity in DNA recognition may be important in gene regulation and in the evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks.}},

    abstract = {{10.1101/gr.5574907 Identifying the genome-wide binding sites of transcription factors is important in deciphering transcriptional regulatory networks. ChIP-chip (Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with microarrays) has been widely used to map transcription factor binding sites in the human genome. However, whole genome ChIP-chip analysis is still technically challenging in vertebrates. We recently developed STAGE as an unbiased method for identifying transcription factor binding sites in the genome. STAGE is conceptually based on SAGE, except that the input is ChIP-enriched DNA. In this study, we implemented an improved sequencing strategy and analysis methods and applied STAGE to map the genomic binding profile of the transcription factor STAT1 after interferon treatment. STAT1 is mainly responsible for mediating the cellular responses to interferons, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, immune surveillance, and immune responses. We present novel algorithms for STAGE tag analysis to identify enriched loci with high specificity, as verified by quantitative ChIP. STAGE identified several previously unknown STAT1 target genes, many of which are involved in mediating the response to interferon-\^{I}¬≥ signaling. STAGE is thus a viable method for identifying the chromosomal targets of transcription factors and generating meaningful biological hypotheses that further our understanding of transcriptional regulatory networks.}},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The genomewide pattern of changes in mRNA expression measured using DNA microarrays is typically a complex superposition of the response of multiple regulatory pathways to changes in the environment of the cells. The use of prior information, either about the function of the protein encoded by each gene, or about the physical interactions between regulatory factors and the sequences controlling its expression, has emerged as a powerful approach for dissecting complex transcriptional responses. RESULTS: We review two different approaches for combining the noisy expression levels of multiple individual genes into robust pathway-level differential expression scores. The first is based on a comparison between the distribution of expression levels of genes within a predefined gene set and those of all other genes in the genome. The second starts from an estimate of the strength of genomewide regulatory network connectivities based on sequence information or direct measurements of protein-DNA interactions, and uses regression analysis to estimate the activity of gene regulatory pathways. The statistical methods used are explained in detail. CONCLUSION: By avoiding the thresholding of individual genes, pathway-level analysis of differential expression based on prior information can be considerably more sensitive to subtle changes in gene expression than gene-level analysis. The methods are technically straightforward and yield results that are easily interpretable, both biologically and statistically.}},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger protein involved in diverse functions ranging from negative regulation of MYC, to chromatin insulation of the beta-globin gene cluster, to imprinting of the Igf2 locus. The 11 zinc fingers of CTCF are known to differentially contribute to the CTCF-DNA interaction at different binding sites. It is possible that the differences in CTCF-DNA conformation at different binding sites underlie CTCF's functional diversity. If so, the CTCF binding sites may belong to distinct classes, each compatible with a specific functional role.RESULTS:We have classified approximately 26,000 CTCF binding sites in CD4+ T cells into three classes based on their similarity to the well-characterized CTCF DNA-binding motif. We have comprehensively characterized these three classes of CTCF sites with respect to several evolutionary, genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic and functional features. We find that the low-occupancy sites tend to be cell type specific. Furthermore, while the high-occupancy sites associate with repressive histone marks and greater gene co-expression within a CTCF-flanked block, the low-occupancy sites associate with active histone marks and higher gene expression. We found that the low-occupancy sites have greater conservation in their flanking regions compared to high-occupancy sites. Interestingly, based on a novel class-conservation metric, we observed that human low-occupancy sites tend to be conserved as low-occupancy sites in mouse (and vice versa) more frequently than expected.CONCLUSIONS:Our work reveals several key differences among CTCF occupancy-based classes and suggests a critical, yet distinct functional role played by low-occupancy sites.}},

    abstract = {{The binding of sequence-specific regulatory factors and the recruitment of chromatin remodeling activities cause nucleosomes to be evicted from chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Traditionally, these active sites have been identified experimentally through their sensitivity to nucleases. Here we describe the details of a simple procedure for the genome-wide isolation of nucleosome-depleted DNA from human chromatin, termed FAIRE (Formaldehyde Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements). We also provide protocols for different methods of detecting FAIRE-enriched DNA, including use of PCR, DNA microarrays, and next-generation sequencing. FAIRE works on all eukaryotic chromatin tested to date. To perform FAIRE, chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde, sheared by sonication, and phenol-chloroform extracted. Most genomic DNA is crosslinked to nucleosomes and is sequestered to the interphase, whereas DNA recovered in the aqueous phase corresponds to nucleosome-depleted regions of the genome. The isolated regions are largely coincident with the location of DNaseI hypersensitive sites, transcriptional start sites, enhancers, insulators, and active promoters. Given its speed and simplicity, FAIRE has utility in establishing chromatin profiles of diverse cell types in health and disease, isolating DNA regulatory elements en masse for further characterization, and as a screening assay for the effects of small molecules on chromatin organization.}},

                DNA segments that actively regulate transcription in vivo are typically characterized by eviction of nucleosomes from chromatin and are experimentally identified by their hypersensitivity to nucleases.

To perform FAIRE, chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde in vivo, sheared by sonication, and phenol-chloroform extracted. The DNA recovered in the aqueous phase is fluorescently labeled and hybridized to a DNA microarray. FAIRE performed in human cells strongly enriches DNA coincident with the location of DNaseI hypersensitive sites, transcriptional start sites, and active promoters. Evidence for cell-type-specific patterns of FAIRE enrichment is also presented. FAIRE has utility as a positive selection for genomic regions associated with regulatory activity, including regions traditionally detected by nuclease hypersensitivity assays.

                The gel electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) is used to detect protein complexes with nucleic acids. It is the core technology underlying a wide range of qualitative and quantitative analyses for the characterization of interacting systems. In the classical assay, solutions of protein and nucleic acid are combined and the resulting mixtures are subjected to electrophoresis under native conditions through polyacrylamide or agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the distribution of species containing nucleic acid is determined, usually by autoradiography of 32P-labeled nucleic acid. In general, protein-nucleic acid complexes migrate more slowly than the corresponding free nucleic acid. In this protocol, we identify the most important factors that determine the stabilities and electrophoretic mobilities of complexes under assay conditions. A representative protocol is provided and commonly used variants are discussed. Expected outcomes are briefly described. References to extensions of the method and a troubleshooting guide are provided.

                Insulator elements affect gene expression by preventing the spread of heterochromatin and restricting transcriptional enhancers from activation of unrelated promoters. In vertebrates, insulator's function requires association with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a protein that recognizes long and diverse nucleotide sequences. While insulators are critical in gene regulation, only a few have been reported. Here, we describe 13,804 CTCF-binding sites in potential insulators of the human genome, discovered experimentally in primary human fibroblasts. Most of these sequences are located far from the transcriptional start sites, with their distribution strongly correlated with genes. The majority of them fit to a consensus motif highly conserved and suitable for predicting possible insulators driven by CTCF in other vertebrate genomes. In addition, CTCF localization is largely invariant across different cell types. Our results provide a resource for investigating insulator function and possible other general and evolutionarily conserved activities of CTCF sites.

The biological importance of transcriptional regulation is highlighted by examples of how alterations in these transcriptional components can lead to disease.

Here we show how many of these algorithms, especially those that model binding specificities of regulatory factors with position specific weight matrices (WMs), naturally arise within a general Bayesian probabilistic framework. We discuss how WMs are constructed from sets of regulatory sites, how sites for a given WM can be discovered by scanning of large sequences, how to cluster WMs, and more generally how to cluster large sets of sites from different WMs into clusters. We discuss how 'regulatory modules', clusters of sites for subsets of WMs, can be found in large intergenic sequences, and we discuss different methods for ab initio motif finding, including expectation maximization (EM) algorithms, and motif sampling algorithms. Finally, we extensively discuss how module finding methods and ab initio motif finding methods can be extended to take phylogenetic relations between the input sequences into account, i.e. we show how motif finding and phylogenetic footprinting can be integrated in a rigorous probabilistic framework. The article is intended for readers with a solid background in applied mathematics, and preferably with some knowledge of general Bayesian probabilistic methods. The main purpose of the article is to elucidate that all these methods are not a disconnected set of individual algorithmic recipes, but that they are just different facets of a single integrated probabilistic theory.}},

                We report the generation and analysis of functional data from multiple, diverse experiments performed on a targeted 1\% of the human genome as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE Project. These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome. Together, these studies are defining a path for pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization of human genome function.

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project was created to enable the scientific and medical communities to interpret the human genome sequence and to use it to understand human biology and improve health. The ENCODE Consortium, a large group of scientists from around the world, uses a variety of experimental methods to identify and describe the regions of the 3 billion base-pair human genome that are important for function. Using experimental, computational, and statistical analyses, we aimed to discover and describe genes, transcripts, and transcriptional regulatory regions, as well as DNA binding proteins that interact with regulatory regions in the genome, including transcription factors, different versions of histones and other markers, and DNA methylation patterns that define states of the genome in various cell types.

    abstract = {{STAMP is a newly developed web server that is designed to support the study of DNA-binding motifs. STAMP may be used to query motifs against databases of known motifs; the software aligns input motifs against the chosen database (or alternatively against a user-provided dataset), and lists of the highest-scoring matches are returned. Such similarity-search functionality is expected to facilitate the identification of transcription factors that potentially interact with newly discovered motifs. STAMP also automatically builds multiple alignments, familial binding profiles and similarity trees when more than one motif is inputted. These functions are expected to enable evolutionary studies on sets of related motifs and fixed-order regulatory modules, as well as illustrating similarities and redundancies within the input motif collection. STAMP is a highly flexible alignment platform, allowing users to 'mix-and-match' between various implemented comparison metrics, alignment methods (local or global, gapped or ungapped), multiple alignment strategies and tree-building methods. Motifs may be inputted as frequency matrices (in many of the commonly used formats), consensus sequences, or alignments of known binding sites. STAMP also directly accepts the output files from 12 supported motif-finders, enabling quick interpretation of motif-discovery analyses. STAMP is available at http://www.benoslab.pitt.edu/stamp.}},

A new web interface with different search options and integrated versions of Match and Patch provides increased functionality for TRANSFAC. The list of databases which are linked to the common GENE table of TRANSFAC and TRANSCompel has been extended by: Ensembl, UniGene, EntrezGene, HumanPSD and TRANSPRO. Standard gene names from HGNC, MGI and RGD, are included for human, mouse and rat genes, respectively. With the help of InterProScan, Pfam, SMART and PROSITE domains are assigned automatically to the protein sequences of the transcription factors. TRANSCompel contains now, in addition to the COMPEL table, a separate table for detailed information on the experimental EVIDENCE on which the composite elements are based. Finally, for TRANSFAC, in respect of data growth, in particular the gain of Drosophila transcription factor binding sites (by courtesy of the Drosophila DNase I footprint database) and of Arabidopsis factors (by courtesy of DATF, Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors) has to be stressed.

For example, hidden Markov models are used for analyzing biological sequences, linguistic-grammar-based probabilistic models for identifying RNA secondary structure, and probabilistic evolutionary models for inferring phylogenies of sequences from different organisms. This book gives a unified, up-to-date and self-contained account, with a Bayesian slant, of such methods, and more generally to probabilistic methods of sequence analysis. Written by an interdisciplinary team of authors, it is accessible to molecular biologists, computer scientists, and mathematicians with no formal knowledge of the other fields, and at the same time presents the state of the art in this new and important field.}},

Algorithms for sequence comparison, including the popular BLAST and FAST programs, are covered.
