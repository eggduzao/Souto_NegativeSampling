    abstract = {{Abstract The faithful execution of biological processes requires a precise and carefully orchestrated set of steps that depend on the proper spatial and temporal expression of genes. Here we review the various classes of transcriptional regulatory elements (core promoters, proximal promoters, distal enhancers, silencers, insulators/boundary elements, and locus control regions) and the molecular machinery (general transcription factors, activators, and coactivators) that interacts with the regulatory elements to mediate precisely controlled patterns of gene expression. The biological importance of transcriptional regulation is highlighted by examples of how alterations in these transcriptional components can lead to disease. Finally, we discuss the methods currently used to identify transcriptional regulatory elements, and the ability of these methods to be scaled up for the purpose of annotating the entire human genome.}},

    abstract = {{Sequence analysis of 236 promoters recognized by the Bacillus subtilis sigma A-RNA polymerase reveals an extended promoter structure. The most highly conserved bases include the -35 and -10 hexanucleotide core elements and a TG dinucleotide at position -15, -14. In addition, several weakly conserved A and T residues are present upstream of the -35 region. Analysis of dinucleotide composition reveals A2- and T2-rich sequences in the upstream promoter region (-36 to -70) which are phased with the DNA helix: An tracts are common near -43, -54 and -65; Tn tracts predominate at the intervening positions. When compared with larger regions of the genome, upstream promoter regions have an excess of An and Tn sequences for n > 4. These data indicate that an RNA polymerase binding site affects DNA sequence as far upstream as -70. This sequence conservation is discussed in light of recent evidence that the alpha subunits of the polymerase core bind DNA and that the promoter may wrap around RNA polymerase.}},

Computational techniques show good accuracy in gene prediction but are less successful in predicting promoters, primarily because of the high number of false positives that reflect characteristics of the promoter sequences. Many machine learning methods have been used to address this issue. Neural Networks (NN) have been successfully used in this field because of their ability to recognize imprecise and incomplete patterns characteristic of promoter sequences. In this paper, NN was used to predict and recognize promoter sequences in two data sets: (i) one based on nucleotide sequence information and (ii) another based on stability sequence information. The accuracy was approximately 80\% for simulation (i) and 68\% for simulation (ii). In the rules extracted, biological consensus motifs were important parts of the NN learning process in both simulations.}},

    abstract = {{Motivation: Prediction of microRNA (miRNA) target mRNAs using machine learning approaches is an important area of research. However, most of the methods suffer from either high false positive or false negative rates. One reason for this is the marked deficiency of negative examples or miRNA non-target pairs. Systematic identification of non-target mRNAs is still not addressed properly, and therefore, current machine learning approaches are compelled to rely on artificially generated negative examples for training.  Results: In this article, we have identified [\~{}]300 tissue-specific negative examples using a novel approach that involves expression profiling of both miRNAs and mRNAs, miRNA-mRNA structural interactions and seed-site conservation. The newly generated negative examples are validated with pSILAC dataset, which elucidate the fact that the identified non-targets are indeed non-targets.These high-throughput tissue-specific negative examples and a set of experimentally verified positive examples are then used to build a system called TargetMiner, a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier. In addition to assessing the prediction accuracy on cross-validation experiments, TargetMiner has been validated with a completely independent experimental test dataset. Our method outperforms 10 existing target prediction algorithms and provides a good balance between sensitivity and specificity that is not reflected in the existing methods. We achieve a significantly higher sensitivity and specificity of 69\% and 67.8\% based on a pool of 90 feature set and 76.5\% and 66.1\% using a set of 30 selected feature set on the completely independent test dataset.  In order to establish the effectiveness of the systematically generated negative examples, the SVM is trained using a different set of negative data generated using the method in Yousef et al. A significantly higher false positive rate (70.6\%) is observed when tested on the independent set, while all other factors are kept the same. Again, when an existing method (NBmiRTar) is executed with the our proposed negative data, we observe an improvement in its performance. These clearly establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach of selecting the negative examples systematically.

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Recently, supervised learning methods have been exploited to reconstruct gene regulatory networks from gene expression data. The reconstruction of a network is modeled as a binary classification problem for each pair of genes. A statistical classifier is trained to recognize the relationships between the activation profiles of gene pairs. This approach has been proven to outperform previous unsupervised methods. However, the supervised approach raises open questions. In particular, although known regulatory connections can safely be assumed to be positive training examples, obtaining negative examples is not straightforward, because definite knowledge is typically not available that a given pair of genes do not interact.RESULTS:A recent advance in research on data mining is a method capable of learning a classifier from only positive and unlabeled examples, that does not need labeled negative examples. Applied to the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks, we show that this method significantly outperforms the current state of the art of machine learning methods. We assess the new method using both simulated and experimental data, and obtain major performance improvement.CONCLUSIONS:Compared to unsupervised methods for gene network inference, supervised methods are potentially more accurate, but for training they need a complete set of known regulatory connections. A supervised method that can be trained using only positive and unlabeled data, as presented in this paper, is especially beneficial for the task of inferring gene regulatory networks, because only an incomplete set of known regulatory connections is available in public databases such as RegulonDB, TRRD, KEGG, Transfac, and IPA.}},

@article{park2011,
    abstract = {{Motivation: A number of computational methods have been proposed that predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) based on protein sequence features. Since the number of potential non-interacting protein pairs (negative PPIs) is very high both in absolute terms and in comparison to that of interacting protein pairs (positive PPIs), computational prediction methods rely upon subsets of negative PPIs for training and validation. Hence, the need arises for subset sampling for negative PPIs.Results: We clarify that there are two fundamentally different types of subset sampling for negative PPIs. One is subset sampling for cross-validated testing, where one desires unbiased subsets so that predictive performance estimated with them can be safely assumed to generalize to the population level. The other is subset sampling for training, where one desires the subsets that best train predictive algorithms, even if these subsets are biased. We show that confusion between these two fundamentally different types of subset sampling led one study recently published in Bioinformatics to the erroneous conclusion that predictive algorithms based on protein sequence features are hardly better than random in predicting PPIs. Rather, both protein sequence features and the 'hubbiness' of interacting proteins contribute to effective prediction of PPIs. We provide guidance for appropriate use of random versus balanced sampling.Availability: The datasets used for this study are available at http://www.marcottelab.org/PPINegativeDataSampling.Contact: yungki@mail.utexas.edu; marcotte@icmb.utexas.eduSupplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

    abstract = {{MOTIVATION: Small non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes play important regulatory roles in a variety of cellular processes. However, detection of ncRNA genes is a great challenge to both experimental and computational approaches. In this study, we describe a new approach called positive sample only learning (PSoL) to predict ncRNA genes in the Escherichia coli genome. Although PSoL is a machine learning method for classification, it requires no negative training data, which, in general, is hard to define properly and affects the performance of machine learning dramatically. In addition, using the support vector machine (SVM) as the core learning algorithm, PSoL can integrate many different kinds of information to improve the accuracy of prediction. Besides the application of PSoL for predicting ncRNAs, PSoL is applicable to many other bioinformatics problems as well. RESULTS: The PSoL method is assessed by 5-fold cross-validation experiments which show that PSoL can achieve about 80\% accuracy in recovery of known ncRNAs. We compared PSoL predictions with five previously published results. The PSoL method has the highest percentage of predictions overlapping with those from other methods.}},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The application of machine learning to classification problems that depend only on positive examples is gaining attention in the computational biology community. We and others have described the use of two-class machine learning to identify novel miRNAs. These methods require the generation of an artificial negative class. However, designation of the negative class can be problematic and if it is not properly done can affect the performance of the classifier dramatically and/or yield a biased estimate of performance. We present a study using one-class machine learning for microRNA (miRNA) discovery and compare one-class to two-class approaches using na\"{i}ve Bayes and Support Vector Machines. These results are compared to published two-class miRNA prediction approaches. We also examine the ability of the one-class and two-class techniques to identify miRNAs in newly sequenced species. RESULTS: Of all methods tested, we found that 2-class naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines gave the best accuracy using our selected features and optimally chosen negative examples. One class methods showed average accuracies of 70-80\% versus 90\% for the two 2-class methods on the same feature sets. However, some one-class methods outperform some recently published two-class approaches with different selected features. Using the EBV genome as and external validation of the method we found one-class machine learning to work as well as or better than a two-class approach in identifying true miRNAs as well as predicting new miRNAs. CONCLUSION: One and two class methods can both give useful classification accuracies when the negative class is well characterized. The advantage of one class methods is that it eliminates guessing at the optimal features for the negative class when they are not well defined. In these cases one-class methods can be superior to two-class methods when the features which are chosen as representative of that positive class are well defined.}},
